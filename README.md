Features

Transformer Architecture: The chatbot is built upon the Transformer Encoder-Decoder architecture, which allows it to handle long-range dependencies in conversations effectively.

Customizable: You can fine-tune the chatbot for your specific use case by adjusting hyperparameters, training on a domain-specific dataset, or modifying the model architecture.

Pretrained Models: You can start with pretrained weights or train the model from scratch.

User-Friendly Interface: The chatbot provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.


usage
To use the chatbot, follow these steps:

Dataset: Prepare your dataset or use the provided sample data.

Training: Train the chatbot model.

Inference: Use the trained model to generate responses.

Dataset
To train the chatbot, you need a conversation dataset. The dataset should be in a specific format, where each line contains a dialogue turn in the format "user: message" or "bot: message."

You can find sample conversation data in the data/ directory to get started.

Training
You can train the chatbot model using the following command:


Model Architecture
The chatbot uses a custom implementation of the Transformer Encoder-Decoder architecture. For detailed information about the model architecture and design choices, see Model Architecture.
